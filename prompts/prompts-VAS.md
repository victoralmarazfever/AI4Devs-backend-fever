# Prompt 2

As an expert developer, following DDD, SOLID and DRY principles, let's work on this project to create two new endpoints.
I will guide you in any step. Don't code until I confirm you.

The endpoints must meet this design:
- GET /positions/:id/candidates
  - This endpoint will get all candidates in progress for a specific position.
  - It must return the full name, current_interview_step, the average score
- PUT /candidates/:id/stage
  - This endpoint will update the candidate stage

# Prompt 3

Could you please run it to make sure it works?
